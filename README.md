Warren Buffett: Preface to the fourth Edition

I read the first edition of <a href="https://the-intelligent-investor.site/">The Intelligent Investor PDF</a> book in early 1950, when I was 19 years old. At the time, I thought it was the best investment book ever written. I still think so.

To achieve success in investing, you do not need a supernaturally high value of the IQ, an unusual approach to doing business or possession of insider information. Success requires a reasonable approach to decision-making and the ability to restrain emotions in order to protect your method from their destructive power. This book accurately and clearly describes the appropriate approach. First of all, you should adhere to emotional discipline.

If you adhere to the behavioral and business principles that Graham promotes, and pay special attention to the invaluable advice set out in chapters 8 and 20, you will not be disappointed with the results of your investment activities. (They contain more necessary knowledge than it seems.) Whether you will be able to achieve outstanding results or not will depend on your attempts and reasonable actions when investing, as well as on the reckless amplitude of the stock market behavior. The stupider the behavior of the stock market, the higher the opportunities for an investor who behaves like a businessman. Follow Graham's advice and you will be able to profit from the vagaries of the stock market rather than participate in them.

For me personally, Benjamin Graham was not just the author of this The Intelligent Investor PDF book or my teacher. After my father, of all men, he had the most tangible impact on my life. Shortly after his death in 1976, I wrote a brief obituary about him in the Financial Accounting Journal. I think that as you read this book, you will appreciate some of the qualities mentioned in it.
